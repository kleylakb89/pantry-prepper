## Description 
- Life can be a bit stale sometimes, we wanted to make a site that could deliver something new to the users life. Being hungry for both food and knowledge, we decided to make a website that generates recipes that include the users desired ingredient of their choice. This websites functions by first, the user is greeted by 3 randomly populated recipes. From here if the user would like to learn more about those recipes, they simply click and a new tab is opened with more info on that recipe. If the random recipes doesnt suit the users fancy, they may then search a desired ingredient. Upon the users search our site finds all recipes that include their desired ingredient, and displays them to the user. If the user would like to know the average price for their desired ingredient, they may also find that with a simple check of a check box found below the users search input.
